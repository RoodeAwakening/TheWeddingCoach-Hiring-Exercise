# Welcome Frontend Product Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  Javascript
FRAMEWORKS: React and any libraries you want
TESTS:      nice to have, but not mandatory
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview
This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to one of the exercises below in the time allotted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. This is NOT a test of how well you know React or ES7+, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend.

Ideally, your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

There is starter data in djData.json.
